## Search Algorithm
Search algorithm are designed to find the required data in the data structure where is it stored
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Depth First Search - DFS
- Breadth First Search - DFS
- Jump Search - DFS

## Sort Algorithm
Sort algorithms are used to rearrange array or given list of element according to the comparison operator. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure
- Quick sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Bubble sort
- Tim sort
- Radix sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort

## Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming can optimize recursion. DP store the results of subproblem for recomputation in further problem. This simple optimization reduces time complextities from exponencial to polynomial
- Fibonacci number series
- Knapsack problem
- Tower of hanoi
- Shortest path by dijkastra
- Matrix chain multiplication

## Recursive Algorithm
A recursive algorithm is an algorithm which calls itself with smaller or simpler input values, and the result for the current input by applying simple operations to the returned value for the smaller input
- Factorial
- Exponential
- Tower of hanoi
- Tree traversals
- DFS of graph

## Greedy Algorithm
Greedy is an algorithm paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benifit
- Huffman coding
- Fractional knapsack problem
- Activity selection
- Job sequencing problem
